## Fun with C#

C# is a versatile language developed by Microsoft. It powers a wide range of applications, from web backends (ASP.NET Core) to desktop apps (WPF, WinForms) and game development (Unity).

### Key Features Often Used:

*   **LINQ:** Language-Integrated Query makes data manipulation elegant.
    ```csharp
    var results = myList.Where(x => x > 10).Select(x => x * 2);
    ```
*   **Async/Await:** Simplifies asynchronous programming.
*   **Pattern Matching:** Enhanced in recent versions for more expressive code.
